This is a 14-man team premiere project completed at Hamoye


#### Project Title: Animal Wildlife Classification
Animal wildlife classification using deep learning represents a significant leap forward in biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts. Traditional methods, which rely on manual identification, are increasingly impractical due to the vast amounts of data generated by modern monitoring tools.

Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), automates the classification process by identifying features and patterns in images that indicate specific animal species.

Despite challenges faced with detecting animal species, the integration of deep learning promises to revolutionize wildlife conservation, offering comprehensive monitoring capabilities for protecting global biodiversity.


#### Objectives:
This project is aimed at developing deep learning algorithms capable of accurately and efficiently recognizing and categorizing animal species in images, spanning a wide range of environments and species.
The solution proferred here fuses a CNN solution with the transfer learning technique, EfficientNetV2L, for the best model.

#### Approach:
1. Image Rescaling
2. Data Optimization
3. Data Augumentation
	+ Flip- Left-right, 
	+ Adjust_brightness 
	+ Adjust_constrast.
4. Model Selection
	+ Training : Validation : Testing dataset in the ratio 0.7 : 0.2 : 0.1
5. Model Development and Compilation (Sequential)
	+ Three(3) convolutional layers were created (inside the convolutional layers were maximum pooling layers)  with an activation function called rectified linear unit(Relu).
	+ Efficient Net V2L was employed to improve the accuracy/performance of our sequential model.
6. Model Evaluation
	+ Among the various models tested, EfficientNetV2L stood out, delivering exceptional performance. It achieved an impressive accuracy of 98.67% on the test data, showcasing its robust generalization ability. On the validation set, it attained a high accuracy of 98.33%, showcasing it does not overfit. Even during training, EfficientNetV2L achieved an accuracy of 98.96%.
